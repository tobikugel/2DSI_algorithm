# 2DSI_algorithm

In the course of writing my Master's thesis, I will be pushing my Jupyter Notebooks about the concept of the 2DSI phase retrieval algorithm onto GitHub.

The conceptual notebooks will contain the following files:
* 2DSI_Map_Creator
** A laser pulse is created and its corresponding 2DSI map computationally calculated.
* Group_Delay_Extractor
* Group_Delay_Integration
* Pulse_Displayer
