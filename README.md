# 2DSI_algorithm
This repository is containing the files of my Jupyter Notebooks, which are describing the principle of the phase retrieval algorithm of <a href="https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-31-13-2063">Two-dimensional spectral shearing interferometry </a> (2DSI). The example given will be about the phase reconstruction of a mid-IR pulse centered at $2.3~\mu$m.

Please feel free to read my paper concerning this work <a href="https://opg.optica.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-61-4-1076">here</a>.

## Usage
How does one go about using it?
Provide various use cases and code examples here.


## Project Status
Project is: No longer being worked on.
I've made this repository to demonstrate the principle of the phase retrieval algorithm in my Masters thesis.


## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Improve flexibility towards new parameters (e.g., center wavelength, spectral width, etc.)
- Implement a pulseTransformer function that is more flexible to changes
