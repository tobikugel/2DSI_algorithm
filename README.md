# 2DSI_algorithm
This repository is containing the files of my Jupyter Notebooks, which are describing the principle of the phase retrieval algorithm of <a href="https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-31-13-2063">Two-dimensional spectral shearing interferometry </a> (2DSI). The example given will be about the phase reconstruction of a mid-IR pulse centered at $2.3~\mu$m.

Please feel free to read my paper concerning this work <a href="https://opg.optica.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-61-4-1076">here</a>.
