# 2DSI_algorithm

In the course of writing my Master's thesis, I will be pushing my Jupyter Notebooks about the concept of the 2DSI phase retrieval algorithm onto GitHub.

The conceptual notebooks will contain the following files:
* 2DSI_Map_Creator (done)
    * A laser pulse is created and its corresponding 2DSI map is computationally calculated.
* Group_Delay_Extraction (pending)
* Group_Delay_Integration (pending)
* Pulse_Displayer (pending)

Please feel free to read my paper concerning this work <a href="https://opg.optica.org/ao/abstract.cfm?uri=ao-61-4-1076">here</a>.

# 2DSI_algorithm
This repository is containing the file of my Jupyter Notebooks, which are describing the principle of the phase retrieval algorithm of <a href="https://opg.optica.org/ol/abstract.cfm?uri=ol-31-13-2063">Two-dimensional spectral shearing interferometry </a> (2DSI). The example given will be about the phase reconstruction of a mid-IR pulse.
